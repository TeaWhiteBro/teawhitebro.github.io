<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm now a master student at National University of Singapore(NUS) majoring in Computing. At the same time, I'm working as Generative AI Research Intern at Riot Games. Previously, I was working as a research assistant at [Nanjing University (Suzhou Campus)](https://njusz.nju.edu.cn/main.htm). Before joining NUS, I graduated with a bachelor's degree advised by [Prof. Ruihui Li](http://csee.hnu.edu.cn/people/liruihui) at [Hunan University](https://www.hnu.edu.cn/).

My research interest lies in computer graphics, especially in reconstruction and generation of 3d digital humans.
